# DeLux: Lighting Artifact Removal from RGB Video Using Neuromorphic Data

This repository contains the official implementation of **DeLux**, a deep learning framework for removing lighting artifacts (lens flares, glare, flicker, overexposure) from RGB video sequences by leveraging neuromorphic event data.

Developed as part of the master's thesis:  
**"Lighting Artifact Removal from RGB Video Sequences Using Neuromorphic Data"**  
by Bartosz Stachowiak, 2025

## 📌 Key Features

- Unified detection and removal of lighting artifacts using RGB + event data
- Modular architecture supporting different fusion and loss configurations
- Support for both real-world ([E2VID](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/E2VID.html), [DSEC](https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch/dsec-datasets/download/)) and synthetic datasets ([CARLA](https://carla.org/), custom augmenters)
- Evaluation tools for detection, image quality, and artifact removal metrics
